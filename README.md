# Plan(t) Ahead

## Description:
This application allows users to search for specific plants and add their selection to project garden ideas.  The user also has the ability to share their knowledge/experience in growing certain plants and sharing their thoughts with the community over the application. 
This application has potential for interest amongst many different demographics, most specifically users interested in horticulture or retired users. We believe it is important to preserve nature and provide knowledge for this preservation, and our app allows our users to expand their knowledge of plants and how to properly care for them.

# Plan(t) Ahead

## Description:
This application allows users to search for specific plants and add their selection to project garden ideas.  The user also has the ability to share their knowledge/experience in growing certain plants and sharing their thoughts with the community over the application. 
This application has potential for interest amongst many different demographics, most specifically users interested in horticulture or retired users. We believe it is important to preserve nature and provide knowledge for this preservation, and our app allows our users to expand their knowledge of plants and how to properly care for them.

## Future Development:
- Incorporate functionality where user can upload a photo of specific garden/landscaping area and drag and drop photos of chosen plants and arrange them into the photo as a visual understanding of what their completed project will look like. 

- Finish Community Page to allow users to write and share their experiences, advice, and expertise in the plant world.

- Partnering with a large plant provider like Home Depot, so the user can place their project orders from the site

- Recommendations to users about which plants will thrive in their specific region and climate.
